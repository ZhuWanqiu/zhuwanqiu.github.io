            <h1 id="1-Research-Resource"><a href="#1-Research-Resource" class="headerlink" title="1. Research Resource"></a>1. Research Resource</h1><p>In this week I finally figured out what I want to make as final project – I want to capture people and their lives in the form of video art and photo and build up a website for demonstration. I think maybe most of us do not have a really thrilling adventure or stories full of up and downs, but we still need to share something to reach out – our love, our fear, our trivial lives. </p>
<p>Like the Movie I fond of,<em>Life in A Day</em>, pieces of everyone’s seems arouse a strong sympathy to me. Someone lost their beloved, someone got married, someone met a friend not seen in years, someone played soccer with his teammates, someone starved and have nowhere to sleep, someone watched a movie, someone struggled to finish her assignments…this makes me feel real and connected to each other. We are not living in our own lives; we live in each other people’s lives and the trivial, tiny pieces of life light up a whole world.</p>

<h1 id="2-Explorations"><a href="#2-Explorations" class="headerlink" title="2 Explorations"></a>2 Explorations</h1><p>In the Monday’s class, I can discuss with my classmates and friends about their experience with life sharing. We can try to find more resources about story sharing by expending the topic to the story-sharing website or people-recording video they heard of and they liked. We can also talk about the type of story I can record and the availability to find people to share their own story. </p>
<p>The problem I want to solve will include but not only be limited in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you have ever heard or tried some stories-sharing websites? Or have you ever watched any story-telling videos? How do you like them?</li>
<li>Is there any story you want to hear in story-sharing or life sharing videos? If so, tell me more about it.</li>
<li>In what form do you think is better to deliver one’s life or story or idea? On-street interview or following shot, or else?</li>
<li>Are you interested in sharing your life with us?</li>
<li>Are you interested in my final project? Do you have any feedback about my idea?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-Materials"><a href="#3-Materials" class="headerlink" title="3. Materials"></a>3. Materials</h1><p>The materials I need in this project will not be tangible things, but like stories or pieces of everybody’s daily life. I will upload my information online to find people who want to share their stories and lives to me and I can invite passerby to share something with me and the audience.</p>
<p>If they have not come up with a complete story, I can ask the following questions as trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s in your pocket? </li>
<li>How do you define love?</li>
<li>What’s your fear?</li>
<li>What’s your favorite picture you took by yourselves?</li>
<li>What is like to be alive?</li>
<li>What will make you cry in midnight?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-Tools"><a href="#4-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4. Tools"></a>4. Tools</h1><p>The tools I need necessarily will be my camera and voice recorder, of course. <strong>But the things I need most will be my respect and sincerity to every people’s story and everyone’s life</strong>. You cannot neglect, or even deny their existence even though they are little and humble, and you cannot try to avoid it or even get rid of it because those tiny things have already become part of who you are.</p>
<p>That’s it, current what I want to do in final project.</p>

<p>What is <strong>art pieces</strong>? I have to think back to what it is. Fine arts, digital arts, painting, sculpture, etc., as we discussed last week, are various kinds of art pieces. For me, the art pieces I want to make remains an open issue.</p>

<p>–(Here is a picture of my mind-map: the pink circles are my interests and my skills. What did I basically do is mapping my skills and interests together to make different possibilities.)</p>
<p>After following different paths, there are some possibilities of my final work.</p>

<h2 id="Sharing…"><a href="#Sharing…" class="headerlink" title="Sharing…"></a>Sharing…</h2><p>While sharing to others, I found all the messy thoughts became clearer and clearer. I know what I really want to do - the story sharing or telling thing. But I haven’t made up my mind on the final form of the story sharing.</p>
<p>It’s always a please to listen to others idea. Some of my classmates want to make their art pieces in reality, like home decorations (like Sam) or wedding grown (like Gina). Some of them want to have a space for users to create things by themselves and some want to make a personal website. Art can be in different kinds of form, and all the forms can be powerful and meaningful, as long as you put yourselves into it.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to the final works of my fellow classmates and of course, to what I can make in this semester.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>At the end of the class, even though there was not enough time but I still got some feedback from my friends.</p>
<p>While browsing all my interests, Sam and Gina mentioned that they had interest in all my written topics but they are way too broad. But <strong>travel</strong> can be a strong and inclusive topic that includes everything we mentioned before. </p>
<p>So travel blog can be an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Why there are so many appealing things in the world! I can barely make up my mind! I need more time……</p>

Why did people invent such (silly or smart) rules to govern, regulate, guide their life or work? Maybe that’s for good purpose. But for me, rules is not for all the abovehead endings.

And there are different reasons for people to adopt (or create) rules and let them be part of their life. It can be personal experience, self-learning, parent teaching or learning from friends and so-on. But I think what really matters is the impact those rules have on you.</p>

<p>Now as my students, assignment has already become part of my daily routine, or my rules <del>FINISH ALL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS OR YOU SHALL NOT PASS(joking)</del></p>
<p>But assignments is not a drill and kill for me. For most theoretical and pedagogical classes, finishing assignment is a better way to reflect and response than just sitting in the classroom and acception what the lecturer want to make sense. </p>
<p>One of the best assignment, or class I have to say is the <strong>individual learning</strong>. Through all the self-learning process, I can control the timing and progress of different learning sections and have more freedom to choose what I want to learn and present in the class. I think that is what a ideal assignment should be like. </p>
<p>But for many of my friends, assignment can always be negative for the heavy wordload can davastate a whole lovely, sunny weekend and they are, <strong>inevitale</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="So-is-there-a-proper-solution-for-assignment-to-delightable"><a href="#So-is-there-a-proper-solution-for-assignment-to-delightable" class="headerlink" title="So is there a proper solution for assignment to delightable?"></a>So is there a proper solution for assignment to delightable?</h3><p>Besides self-control learning process, there is another solution that assignment can be more <strong>interactive</strong>. Nothing like drill and kill, but like finishing one task with a clear goal and the thorough guide of teachers. More sense of achievement students get, more passion they would put into next assignment and may learn more than they thought before. </p>

And there are different reasons for people to adopt (or create) rules and let them be part of their life. It can be personal experience, self-learning, parent teaching or learning from friends and so-on. But I think what really matters is the impact those rules have on you.</p>

<p>Now as my students, assignment has already become part of my daily routine, or my rules <del>FINISH ALL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS OR YOU SHALL NOT PASS(joking)</del></p>
<p>But assignments is not a drill and kill for me. For most theoretical and pedagogical classes, finishing assignment is a better way to reflect and response than just sitting in the classroom and acception what the lecturer want to make sense. </p>
<p>One of the best assignment, or class I have to say is the <strong>individual learning</strong>. Through all the self-learning process, I can control the timing and progress of different learning sections and have more freedom to choose what I want to learn and present in the class. I think that is what a ideal assignment should be like. </p>
<p>But for many of my friends, assignment can always be negative for the heavy wordload can davastate a whole lovely, sunny weekend and they are, <strong>inevitale</strong>.</p>

Nothing like drill and kill, but like finishing one task with a clear goal and the thorough guide of teachers. More sense of achievement students get, more passion they would put into next assignment and may learn more than they thought before. </p>
