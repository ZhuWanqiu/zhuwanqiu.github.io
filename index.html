<h2 id="Finally-Start-the-interview"><a href="#Finally-Start-the-interview" class="headerlink" title="Finally Start the interview!!!"></a>Finally Start the interview!!!</h2><p>I owe Erin a big apology because this post I should upload by Friday but because the interview are all organized in this weekend so I plan to upload on Sunday to write some reflection about the first interview.</p>
<p>####Preparation of the First Interview<br>Things we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera GH5</li>
<li>Camera GH7</li>
<li>Voice recorder *2</li>
<li>Magnesium light *4 (borrow from MACC lab)</li>
<li>The interviewee is my classmate who wants to be a Sci-fi writer and has done a ton of effort in this field. We are so glad that she said yes on our interview request.</li>
</ul>
<p>####Interview in process<br><img src="http://wx3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7f7fc4cagy1fl7t42ish7j20zk0qo79l.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://wx3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7f7fc4cagy1fl7t44z6bqj20zk0qojvz.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7f7fc4cagy1fl7t40b71pj20zk0k010i.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7f7fc4cagy1fl7t4iivuoj20zk0qogux.jpg" alt="image"><br>Even though we have already known a lot about the interviewee, we still feel we can dig deeper in this interview, about why she has that dream so long, anyone support her, anyone discourage her…It’s a really interesting journey that you know your friends deeper and deeper while your curiosity never disgrade even a little. </p>
<p>For a good interview video, recording interview with the interviewee is never enough. Before the interview, we write down all the questions that we will ask and set up a schedule to record B-rolls and nice pictures. To match the visual scene and the thing interviewee memtioned, we need to somehow guide interviewee to follow our arrangement, which was not that easy.</p>
<p>The shooting lasts from 9:00am to 6:00pm. </p>
<p>A long day.</p>
<p>Extausted but satisfied.</p>
<p>We finally got the things we want. But it’s only a beginning.</p>
<p>##Reflection of the feedback</p>
<p>Erin was a little bit concerned the schedule of the project that if I can finish it in time.</p>
<p>And other fellows says if I have trouble in finding people to interview to share their own story, I can find them to interview. Thanks, by the way.</p>
<p>According to the timeline, I need to speed up and interview another people next weekend.</p>
<p>Hope everything goes well.</p>
<p>##Assignment to Myself</p>
<p>I’d like to ask for a reflection video (have limition on time) about the process and eveything so far. I choose reflection video because that is a way can visually demenstrate the process for the audience in the meanwhile it is also a way for students to learn to organize a presentation themselves with proper time management and content control. Reflection video can also be more powerful than in-class presentaiton because it give students more freedom to demonstrate the process in all kinds of form, not matter in animaition, music or pure talking, way more interesting than in-class limination in time, projector and limited space. It’s also a way for peers to replay the video several time in order to understand the final project.</p>
<p>##Adjustment of the Timeline</p>
<p>The plan A goes well this week and estimatedly I can set four interviews by the end of this semester.</p>
<p>The plan B would have some delay because I am currently putting all my effort on plan A.</p>
<p>That’s it. </p>

<h2 id="Shift-of-the-Plan"><a href="#Shift-of-the-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Shift of the Plan"></a>Shift of the Plan</h2><p>To be honest, I am still struggling to interview people around the main campus and still had no big process. </p>
<p>I guess people sometimes are too busy to share their lives or thoughts with strangers in real life, but they do love to share online, on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, What’s app, Telegram, Wechat, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, etc. </p>
<p>So instead of interview, this week I put my focus on communication online and the communication between Chinese people and the local here.</p>
<p>We have learned English for over twelv years and then go abroad for experiencing more. We learned English in various methods - from class, from TV series, from movies, from books, from real-time communication. We spent a lot of time on vocabulary memorizing, grammar understanding, and the time we spent is too much that we somehow forget the purpose of learning a new Language - for mutual communication and understanding. </p>
<p>Back to the time I was in Taiwan and Finland, I met some foreign friends who are interested in learning Mandarin and struggled to find materials for them to learn basic Chinese. They want to know more about Chinese culture and seek opportunity to visit China or even start their business with Chinese manufacturer. What they had was only the old-schooled Mandarin learning Guide book from which what is taught are far away from casual communication. I cannot find useful materials for them so I taught them Mandarin face to face with simple words I assumed. It did not work on all of my friends at that time. Some of them did not have enough knowledge base to understand what I taught, while some of them made incredible progress and asked me to talk to them in Mandarin all the time (but I speak Mandarin too fast so I said no). This phenomenon makes me think a lot.</p>
<p>Same, in New York, I am always astonished by the people who try to say Chinese to me. They shout “Ni Hao”(你好，hello in Chinese) to me and “Guo Yi Xia” (过一下，excuse me in Chinese). Not only the passersby, more and more schools and communities offer Mandarin class and bilingual immersive environment for children to learn Mandarin systematically. <strong>And even USNEWS suggests that teaching Mandarin Chinese should be a priority for American students for it can provide educational and economical success for the society</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/7a51ffd/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fa0%2F5a%2Fea112b37404996450a62a9e9367c%2F161028-mandarinchinese-editorial.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="The-Plan-so-Far"><a href="#The-Plan-so-Far" class="headerlink" title="The Plan so Far"></a>The Plan so Far</h2><p>This Wednesday I had a meeting with a friend who teaches Mandarin class as teaching assistant in Columbia University. Instead of classroom drill and kill, we all think language learning should be more flexible and casual. In curriculum design, a class should be divided into three parts: I do, you do and we do. “I do” means teacher’s tutorial, which should be as simple and clear as possible. “You do” means student’s one-sided practice with teacher and will get teacher’s direct feedback. “We do” means student’s practice with other students through collaboration. We find that the both offline and online tutorials all focus on “I do” and “you do” but there are not so much space for learners to practice “we do” with proper materials. In order to provide more opportunities for students to practice “you do” and “we do”, we decided to build an online platform for Mandarin learners to look for professional tutor and practice with other learner in interesting activities.</p>
<p>The functionality of the platform includes but not limits in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials</strong>: Learners can join in the online courses designed by qualified TCSOL teacher and receive immediate feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Forum</strong>: If they have any question, they can post their question on forum waiting for other learners’ solution. It’s also a playground for language learner to do activities all together.</li>
<li><strong>Self-learning</strong>: Learners can find online tutorials videos and learn whatever they want and whenever they want in their own pace. </li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>: Learners can be friends with other learners and learn all the stuff together. They can also be friends with Mandarin Chinese tutors and have free talk.</li>
<li><strong>Open to both learners and TCSOL</strong>: It’s a open platform so not only can learners find learning resources, TSCOL tutor can get teaching experience (maybe wages if we launch the project profitable) from this platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is still in process…</p>

<h2 id="Week-by-week-Timeline"><a href="#Week-by-week-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Week-by-week Timeline"></a>Week-by-week Timeline</h2><p>Because the project is due by Dec. 15th and we have a long way to go, so we need speed up.</p>
<ul>
<li>present~11/5: interview with Mandarin learners to investigate the user need and simpply the functionality.</li>
<li>present~11/10: homepage design and find more TSCOL tutors in TC.</li>
<li>11/10~11/17: build the forum and upload the tutor information online.</li>
<li>11/17~11/24: invite students from Mandarin class to use and improve functionality.</li>
<li>11/24~12/1: record tutorial videos and upload them online.</li>
<li>12/1~12/8: build database for students to memorize their process and make friends.</li>
<li>12/15: debug;</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. The things we are going to do in the rest of the time are on the timeline but it does not mean we will exactly follow the timeline. For example, finding Mandarin learners and investigate user need is what we will enact all the time and debug is what we are about to do after designing a page.</p>

<h3 id="Explore"><a href="#Explore" class="headerlink" title="Explore"></a>Explore</h3><p>I started my interview this Wednesday. I prepared my carmera and set tripot in Morningside campus, but what embraced me was now the smile of people. So sad that students were too busy for midterm and group meeting and no one had time for my interview question. </p>
<p>The busy, never-stopping crowd made me reflect on my plan that it is not highly plausible to make successful interview with restless passersby. </p>
<p>Instead, I made some time laspe for Columbia Morningside Campus this week.</p>

<h2 id="Shift-of-My-Plan"><a href="#Shift-of-My-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Shift of My Plan"></a>Shift of My Plan</h2><p>The unsuccessful beginning made me think more about the feasibility of the project. </p>
<p>On-street interview may be not that suitable for story sharing, but what about a platform that people could simply upload their videos and create interaction or relationships based on their video or whatever they upload?</p>
<p><strong>We live in a fragmentational world and our focus can no longer last more than 7s, so place, time, and what you are doing in that place and time matter.</strong></p>
<p>Some people want to look as pretty as possible in their videos; while some want to emphasize on the amazing, mindblowing scenes; some just want to focus on the content of the videos. In this multi-demand world, <strong>can we simplify what they need in general?</strong></p>
<p>The intention of my finding a way for people sharing their moments or stories is to reframe deeper relation and understanding between people from different backgrounds or races.</p>
<p><strong>But do they, the users in general, really have a demand to understand each other, in this world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe they do. And I believe that’s the reason people come to New York City, or other new places, from all over the world. They want to experience more and understand more about the thing they never experience before and the people they don’t know before</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="Future-Plan"><a href="#Future-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Future Plan"></a>Future Plan</h3><p>In the following week I will keep building homepage for this project and start to think more about platform on which people sharing their moment with each other. The conceptual model of how user interacter each other will be figured out.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I will reach out to look for more stories and keep asking for interesting materials in my video.</p>

(<a href="http://strangersproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://strangersproject.com/</a>)<br>And what really amazing is when I hang out with my frineds from NYU and came to Washington Square Part, I found their story exhibition! People crowded to read the anonymous stories and I read some of them as well. One of them is about how their family moved to NY and one is about his ex girlfriend.</p>

<p>It’s a simple video about me and why I want to collect your moments of life. I hope that video can help other understand me and why I want to do this project.</p>
<p>It includes 30+ videos during all my travelling and 20+ videos I shooted in NYC. It’s not that easy to connect all of them within three minutes. </p>
<p>I spent all most all the week on video editing because there are so many various materials and I wanna make it as short and funky as possible.</p>
<p>That’ it, this week’s simple blog. All I want to say is in the video. Please click and enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>CNN iReport</strong> - I am not sure you guys heard about iReport, but I am pretty sure you heard of CNN - are running a successful(I think at least) website that allows people to share their stories, or simply post what’s going on there. If it is interested enough, CNN will contact that recorder and report that story in interview.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/opinions/cnnireport" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.cnn.com/specials/opinions/cnnireport</a></p>
<p><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151111091256-ireport-logo-c1-main.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p><strong>GoodTherapy.org</strong> is a pretty warm story sharing website that collects touching stories of mental or psycho-illness and how they fight against them or be friends with them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/submit-your-story.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.goodtherapy.org/submit-your-story.html</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.mhcp.org/images/goodtherapylogotextredesign.png?crc=142822386" alt="image"></p>
<p>And also there is <strong>Youbute and Twitter channel #Shareyourstory</strong> that allow people to tag to their own life video or story.</p>
<p>Twitter:<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shareyourstory?src=hash&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="external">https://twitter.com/hashtag/shareyourstory?src=hash&amp;lang=en</a><br>Youtube:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shareyourstory" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shareyourstory</a></p>
<h2 id="First-Step"><a href="#First-Step" class="headerlink" title="First Step"></a>First Step</h2><p>My new camera has just delivered! And I am really excited the quality of video I am gonna shoot!</p>
<p><img src="http://wx4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7f7fc4cagy1fk8lgk09snj20yi1a04qq.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>In this weekend, I will make a video that illustrate what I am going to do in this project and calls for more people to contact me to share their stories or special (or do not need to be special) moments in their life.</p>
<p>So in the weekend, I am going to collect materials in Time Square, Central park and wherever I pass by.</p>
<h2 id="Plan-for-this-project"><a href="#Plan-for-this-project" class="headerlink" title="Plan for this project"></a>Plan for this project</h2><p>Stories are always a resource of lessons. Even though nearly all the stories that public to us are somehow touching, having special characters, full of up and downs, ending with unexpected result, stories should not be that way, actually. Any moment of life could be warm, touching, painful, frustrated, thrilled, heartbroken, or normal and sometimes being normal takes up a great part of our lives. But that does not mean that simple, normal lives are not worthy recording. Instead, they are full of sparks of everyday wisdom and meaningful choices in different possibilities. Your smile, hugs, frowns, greeting to each other, the people you meet, the food you eat, they really matters.</p>
<p>So the long-term goal in my mind is building up a story-sharing website that could allow people to share they stories, in whatever form - it could be plain text, images, videos. The website could also have Twitter channel, Youtube channel, Bilibili channel, Wechat Official Account, Quora account to share those meaningful content in different communities.</p>
<p>But first, what do I need to do now is to create several videos by myself to let others understand what I am doing. The demo video can be an Ad to call for more people to tell me their story. So the demo I record can be interview with passerby or my friends’ stories.</p>
<p>If everything goes well, I will complete the first demo this weekend.</p>
<p>And the topic that comes up in my mind could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you define love?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What’s your birthday present this year?</li>
<li>What’s like to be alive?</li>
<li>What’s your biggest fear?</li>
<li>Where do you want to travel?</li>
<li>What’s your favorite food?</li>
<li>Who’s your best friend in high school?</li>
<li>What troubles you when you cannot fall into sleep?</li>
<li>What’s in your pocket?</li>
<li>How do you define loneliness?</li>
<li>Have you ever been to a foreign country before? What happened then?</li>
<li>What do you want to say to your mom?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>I told my idea to one of my friends in this class who came from documentry filming background. She mentioned that it is really hard to edit the materials into video if you have no topic, no story line. So I think I will follow on topic in one video for better editing and better viewing.</p>

            <h1 id="1-Research-Resource"><a href="#1-Research-Resource" class="headerlink" title="1. Research Resource"></a>1. Research Resource</h1><p>In this week I finally figured out what I want to make as final project – I want to capture people and their lives in the form of video art and photo and build up a website for demonstration. I think maybe most of us do not have a really thrilling adventure or stories full of up and downs, but we still need to share something to reach out – our love, our fear, our trivial lives. </p>
<p>Like the Movie I fond of,<em>Life in A Day</em>, pieces of everyone’s seems arouse a strong sympathy to me. Someone lost their beloved, someone got married, someone met a friend not seen in years, someone played soccer with his teammates, someone starved and have nowhere to sleep, someone watched a movie, someone struggled to finish her assignments…this makes me feel real and connected to each other. We are not living in our own lives; we live in each other people’s lives and the trivial, tiny pieces of life light up a whole world.</p>

<h1 id="2-Explorations"><a href="#2-Explorations" class="headerlink" title="2 Explorations"></a>2 Explorations</h1><p>In the Monday’s class, I can discuss with my classmates and friends about their experience with life sharing. We can try to find more resources about story sharing by expending the topic to the story-sharing website or people-recording video they heard of and they liked. We can also talk about the type of story I can record and the availability to find people to share their own story. </p>
<p>The problem I want to solve will include but not only be limited in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you have ever heard or tried some stories-sharing websites? Or have you ever watched any story-telling videos? How do you like them?</li>
<li>Is there any story you want to hear in story-sharing or life sharing videos? If so, tell me more about it.</li>
<li>In what form do you think is better to deliver one’s life or story or idea? On-street interview or following shot, or else?</li>
<li>Are you interested in sharing your life with us?</li>
<li>Are you interested in my final project? Do you have any feedback about my idea?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-Materials"><a href="#3-Materials" class="headerlink" title="3. Materials"></a>3. Materials</h1><p>The materials I need in this project will not be tangible things, but like stories or pieces of everybody’s daily life. I will upload my information online to find people who want to share their stories and lives to me and I can invite passerby to share something with me and the audience.</p>
<p>If they have not come up with a complete story, I can ask the following questions as trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s in your pocket? </li>
<li>How do you define love?</li>
<li>What’s your fear?</li>
<li>What’s your favorite picture you took by yourselves?</li>
<li>What is like to be alive?</li>
<li>What will make you cry in midnight?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-Tools"><a href="#4-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4. Tools"></a>4. Tools</h1><p>The tools I need necessarily will be my camera and voice recorder, of course. <strong>But the things I need most will be my respect and sincerity to every people’s story and everyone’s life</strong>. You cannot neglect, or even deny their existence even though they are little and humble, and you cannot try to avoid it or even get rid of it because those tiny things have already become part of who you are.</p>
<p>That’s it, current what I want to do in final project.</p>

<p>–(Here is a picture of my mind-map: the pink circles are my interests and my skills. What did I basically do is mapping my skills and interests together to make different possibilities.)</p>
<p>After following different paths, there are some possibilities of my final work.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol>
<li><ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox"> Story sharing website.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Sharing…"><a href="#Sharing…" class="headerlink" title="Sharing…"></a>Sharing…</h2><p>While sharing to others, I found all the messy thoughts became clearer and clearer. I know what I really want to do - the story sharing or telling thing. But I haven’t made up my mind on the final form of the story sharing.</p>
<p>It’s always a please to listen to others idea. Some of my classmates want to make their art pieces in reality, like home decorations (like Sam) or wedding grown (like Gina). Some of them want to have a space for users to create things by themselves and some want to make a personal website. Art can be in different kinds of form, and all the forms can be powerful and meaningful, as long as you put yourselves into it.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to the final works of my fellow classmates and of course, to what I can make in this semester.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>At the end of the class, even though there was not enough time but I still got some feedback from my friends.</p>
<p>While browsing all my interests, Sam and Gina mentioned that they had interest in all my written topics but they are way too broad. But <strong>travel</strong> can be a strong and inclusive topic that includes everything we mentioned before. </p>
<p>So travel blog can be an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Why there are so many appealing things in the world! I can barely make up my mind! I need more time……</p>

<p>One of the best assignment, or class I have to say is the <strong>individual learning</strong>.
