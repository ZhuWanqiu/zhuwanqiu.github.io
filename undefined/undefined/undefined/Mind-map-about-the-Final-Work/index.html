<p>What is <strong>art pieces</strong>? I have to think back to what it is. Fine arts, digital arts, painting, sculpture, etc., as we discussed last week, are various kinds of art pieces. For me, the art pieces I want to make remains an open issue.</p>

<p>–(Here is a picture of my mind-map: the pink circles are my interests and my skills. What did I basically do is mapping my skills and interests together to make different possibilities.)</p>
<p>After following different paths, there are some possibilities of my final work.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol>
<li><ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox"> Story sharing website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol>
<li><ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox"> Story telling video collection, like <em>One day</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol>
<li><ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox"> Travel blog platform that has flexible template for users to easily design their travel story, pictures or videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h2 id="Sharing…"><a href="#Sharing…" class="headerlink" title="Sharing…"></a>Sharing…</h2><p>While sharing to others, I found all the messy thoughts became clearer and clearer. I know what I really want to do - the story sharing or telling thing. But I haven’t made up my mind on the final form of the story sharing.</p>
<p>It’s always a please to listen to others idea. Some of my classmates want to make their art pieces in reality, like home decorations (like Sam) or wedding grown (like Gina). Some of them want to have a space for users to create things by themselves and some want to make a personal website. Art can be in different kinds of form, and all the forms can be powerful and meaningful, as long as you put yourselves into it.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to the final works of my fellow classmates and of course, to what I can make in this semester.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>At the end of the class, even though there was not enough time but I still got some feedback from my friends.</p>
<p>While browsing all my interests, Sam and Gina mentioned that they had interest in all my written topics but they are way too broad. But <strong>travel</strong> can be a strong and inclusive topic that includes everything we mentioned before. </p>
<p>So travel blog can be an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Why there are so many appealing things in the world! I can barely make up my mind! I need more time……</p>
